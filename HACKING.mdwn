bup-cron maintenance instructions
=================================

This document describes various aspects of the maintenance of this
software project. For usage instructions, see the
[README](README.mdwn) file.

Release checklist
-----------------

 * make sure tests pass
 * update the `__version_info__` field in `bup-cron`
 * commit everything
 * lay down the git tag (`git tag -s x.y`)

Testing instructions
--------------------

To run the tests, you'll need a copy of the [bup source][] because we
are using the bup test suite, for historical reasons (we wanted to be
in core originally).

Simply get a copy of the bup source and uncompress it in the parent
directory (`../bup`). The test suite also assumes the `bup` is in the
path and is at least at version `0.26`.

The tests are in the [t/](t) directory.
